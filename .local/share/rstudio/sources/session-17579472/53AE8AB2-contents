# Group 14 Analysis

Milestone 1

## Summary

## Introduction:

-   provide some relevant background information on the topic so that someone unfamiliar with it will be prepared to understand the rest of your report.
-   clearly state the question you tried to answer with your project
-   identify and describe the dataset that was used to answer the question
-   **Question: do higher newly hospitalized patient count and low vaccination count lead to greater anxiety search trend.**
-   (DV:search_trends_anxiety) (IV: new_persons_vaccinated, new_hospitalized_patients)

## Methods & Results:

-   describe in written english the methods you used to perform your analysis from beginning to end that narrates the code the does the analysis.
-   your report should include code which:
    -   loads data from the original source on the web
    -   wrangles and cleans the data from itâ€™s original (downloaded) format to the format necessary for the planned classification or clustering analysis
    -   performs a summary of the data set that is relevant for exploratory data analysis related to the planned classification analysis
    -   creates a visualization of the dataset that is relevant for exploratory data analysis related to the planned classification analysis
    -   performs classification or regression analysis
    -   reates a visualization of the result of the analysis note: all tables and figure should have a figure/table number and a legend

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(GGally)

set.seed(310)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
US <- read_csv("data/US.csv") 
head(US)

```

```{r}
US_selected <- US |>
  select(date, search_trends_anxiety, new_persons_vaccinated, new_hospitalized_patients,
         new_confirmed, new_intensive_care_patients) |>
  drop_na()
US_selected

```

```{r}
# (DV:search_trends_anxiety) (IV: new_persons_vaccinated, new_hospitalized_patients)
# new_confirmed
# new_intensive_care_patients

summary_table <- US_selected |> 
  summarize(mean_anxiety_trend = mean(search_trends_anxiety, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_new_vaccinated = mean(new_persons_vaccinated, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_new_hospitalized = mean(new_hospitalized_patients, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_new_confirmed = mean(new_confirmed, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_new_intensive_care = mean(new_intensive_care_patients, na.rm = TRUE))
summary_table

```

```{r}

```

```{r}
ggpairs(US_selected, aes(alpha = 0.5)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 8))

```

```{r}


```
